  [{{ project_name|capitalize }}]({{ project_url }}) (formerly NZBdrone) is a PVR for usenet and bittorrent users. It can monitor multiple RSS feeds for new episodes of your favorite shows and will grab, sort and rename them. It can also be configured to automatically upgrade the quality of files already downloaded when a better quality format becomes available.

  ### Media folders

  We have set `/tv` and `/downloads` as ***optional paths***, this is because it is the easiest way to get started. While easy to use, it has some drawbacks. Mainly losing the ability to hardlink (TL;DR a way for a file to exist in multiple places on the same file system while only consuming one file worth of space), or atomic move (TL;DR instant file moves, rather than copy+delete) files while processing content.

  Use the optional paths if you dont understand, or dont want hardlinks/atomic moves.

  The folks over at servarr.com wrote a good [write-up](https://wiki.servarr.com/Docker_Guide#Consistent_and_well_planned_paths) on how to get started with this.
