  [{{ project_name|capitalize }}]({{ project_url }}) (formerly NZBdrone) is a PVR for usenet and bittorrent users. It can monitor multiple RSS feeds for new episodes of your favorite shows and will grab, sort and rename them. It can also be configured to automatically upgrade the quality of files already downloaded when a better quality format becomes available.

  Access the webui at `<your-ip>:8989`, for more information check out [Sonarr](https://sonarr.tv/).
  Special Note: Following our current folder structure will result in an inability to hardlink from your downloads to your TV folder because they are on seperate volumes. To support hardlinking, simply ensure that the TV and downloads data are on a single volume. For example, if you have /mnt/storage/TV and /mnt/storage/downloads/completed/TV, you would want something like /mnt/storage:/media for your volume. Then you can hardlink from /media/downloads/completed to /media/TV.
  Another item to keep in mind, is that within sonarr itself, you should then map your torrent client folder to your sonarr folder: Settings -> Download Client -> advanded -> remote path mappings. I input the host of my download client (matches the download client defined) remote path is /downloads/TV (relative to the internal container path) and local path is /media/downloads/completed/TV, assuming you have folders to seperate your downloaded data types.
